# Used Car Dataset Analysis Plan

## Phase 1: Data Understanding and Cleaning

1.  **Data Inspection:** Examine the first few rows and last few rows of the `vehicles.csv` file to identify the structure, data types, and potential missing values.
2.  **Data Profiling:** Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns and frequency counts for categorical columns. This will help identify outliers and potential data quality issues.
3.  **Missing Value Handling:** Determine the extent of missing values in each column. Decide on an appropriate strategy to handle them (e.g., imputation, removal).
4.  **Data Type Conversion:** Ensure that data types are consistent and appropriate for analysis. Convert columns to the correct data types if necessary.
5.  **Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Identify and handle outliers in numerical columns (e.g., price, odometer). Decide on an appropriate strategy (e.g., winsorization, removal).

## Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1.  **Univariate Analysis:** Explore the distribution of individual variables (e.g., histograms, box plots) to understand their characteristics.
2.  **Bivariate Analysis:** Investigate relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., scatter plots, correlation matrices) to identify potential correlations between features and price.
3.  **Multivariate Analysis:** Explore relationships between multiple variables simultaneously (e.g., regression analysis) to build predictive models for car prices.

## Phase 3: Recommendation Generation

1.  **Feature Importance:** Based on the EDA, identify the most important features that significantly influence car prices.
2.  **Recommendation Formulation:** Based on the feature importance, provide clear and actionable recommendations to the used car dealership on what aspects of used cars consumers value most. This could include recommendations on pricing strategies, inventory management, and marketing.

## Tools:

*   `read_file`: For inspecting the data.
*   (Potentially) other tools or libraries for data profiling, statistical analysis, and visualization (if I switch to code mode).

## Deliverables:

*   A summary report detailing the data cleaning process, EDA findings, and recommendations.
*   (Potentially) visualizations to support the findings.
